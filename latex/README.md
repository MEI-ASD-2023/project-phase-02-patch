# Lab 01: Writing pseudocode

In this laboratory, you are given the task of learning how to write pseudocode to describe the functionality of a distributed algorithm. The pseudocode that you write will depend on the ideal link abstraction that will be used to convey the operation of the network.

Writing pseudocode is an important challenge and skill, and allows conceptualisation of problems before having to commit to writing code to solve them.

## Task: Write Reliable Broadcast Pseudocode (in LaTeX)

In the directory `latex-notes` you will find a document that explains how to write pseudocode for distributed algorithms, and various examples corresponding to algorithms that assume various network link models.

This week's assignment is to write a new version of the "Reliable Broadcast" procedure displayed in `lab01-assignment.tex` to reduce the network load of the algorithm. You should write the pseudocode of your solution in LaTeX in that file.
